    <h2>Brief about me</h2>
    Hello! I'm Leah, a <strong>Project Manager</strong> based in Seoul, Korea. 
    (the one with <u>K-pop</u>, not Kim Jong-un)
    <p margin="20px">
    <img src="profile.png" width="30%"></p>
    <p>
        I'm currently studying for <br>
        the PMP (Project Management Professional) certification <br>
        to evaluate my skills and boost my professionalism.</p>
    <p>Before this, I successfully launched and operated <br>
        various projects for over four years. <br>
        My clients were so satisfied that <br>
        we ended up working together on multiple projects.</p>
    <p>Prior to that, I worked at several companies, <br>
        gaining experience in music distribution, website management, <br>
        revenue settlement system planning, CMS management, <br>
        foreign language translation, business development, and more.</p>
    <p>When I'm not working, I love trying new things, <br>
        hanging out with amazing people, <br>
        and catching up on some much-needed sleep. <br>
        After all, even project managers need their 'reboot' time!</p>
    <p>According to the MBTI test, I'm an <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/ko/%EC%84%B1%EA%B2%A9%EC%9C%A0%ED%98%95-esfj" target="_blank" title="ESFJ Official Descriptions by 16 Personalities">ESFJ</a>, <br>
        which means I excel at organizing and ensuring everyone feels valued. <br>
        My focus on detail and harmony ensures <br>
        projects are completed efficiently and empathetically.</p>
    <p>Need precise project management with a personal touch? <br>
        You’ve found the perfect match, and lucky for you, <br>
        I’m available at this moment!</p>
